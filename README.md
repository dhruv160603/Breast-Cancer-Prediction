🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on key diagnostic features. It leverages labeled medical data to train and evaluate multiple classification algorithms for early cancer detection.

✅ Objective: Accurately classify tumors as benign or malignant using diagnostic measurements.

📊 Dataset: Features such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc., from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

🤖 Models Used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

🧪 Techniques: Feature selection, data normalization, train-test split, confusion matrix, ROC curve analysis, accuracy and precision evaluation.

📈 Outcome: Achieved high prediction accuracy with low false negative rate, supporting early diagnosis and improving treatment planning.

🔍 This project demonstrates the practical use of machine learning in medical diagnostics and showcases how data-driven models can assist healthcare professionals in making reliable clinical decisions.
